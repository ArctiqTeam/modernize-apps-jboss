# Prerequisites

TBD. This section will be filled out with requirements for installing
several pieces of software before these instructions will work.

## Source code for exercises

The source code required for the exercises in this guide is in a
_Git_ repository on `github.com`. To use this source code,
you must _clone_ the repository into your `$HOME/projects` directory.

For example, the following command will clone the source code into
the appropriate directory for use with the guide:

```
git clone -b v1.0 https://github.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/modernize-apps-labs $HOME/projects
```

There is also a _solution_ branch in this repository, which refers to
the source code of the solution for each exercise. To access the solution,
you can use `git checkout v1.0_solution`.
